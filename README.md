- Employment history – Borrowers with consistent employee history of >6-7 years could be less risky
- Smaller loans should be approved for low graded borrowers
- High risk borrowers should be given a short tenure loan
- Verification process for the loans should be little more stringent
- Applicants with higher income could be given more diversified loans
